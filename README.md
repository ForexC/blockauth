## What is BlockAuth...?

BlockAuth provides a way for individuals to control their identity.

It is an extremely early working prototype that provides a way for users to self-manage their own registrations and authenticate with other services without being forced to provide an email address whilst also allowing the individual to choose just how much of their identity they reveal in the process.

__TODO:__

* Remove the manual GET process of the registration form
* Need to add a way for adding your own return_address
* Add addresses for all eight chains (to config.ini)

## The Specification

The specfication is changing on a daily, sometimes hourly basis and has been opened to thepublic as early as possible in the hope of getting more people involved in the idea.

## Examples

Please note that if you are visting this documentation from [blockauth.org](http://blockauth.org) there is a basic example that can be seen working below, which is also included within the [public repo](https://github.com/Neuroware-IO/blockauth) that powers this website. The documentation seen on [blockauth.org](http:/blockauth.org) is the same README-powered documentation seen within the public [GitHub](https://github.com/Neuroware-IO/blockauth) repository.
